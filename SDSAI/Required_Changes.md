# 1 / Programming for DS and AI
*   Possibly drop the assignment operators (e.g. `+=`), this does not add much of use and is confusing without a clear application
*   Possibly add the logic tables when introducing `and` and `or`
*   Move logical types before sequence types
*   When if...else is introduced, line one has `float(input())` this might be clearer as two separate lines

# 2 / 
*   Too much material, need more space for practice/exercises
*   Examples are not showing in slides

# 3 / ML Foundations and Data Prep
*   Too much material
*   Data standardisation/normalisation is hard to justify without having seen how a basic model works
*   In exercise 3.1 - clarify what is meant by variation/variability
